    <li style="margin: 10px 20px ;font-weight: bolder;">INTRODUCTION</li>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as intelligence exhibited by an artificial entity. Such a 
        system is generally assumed to be a computer. Although AI has a strong science fiction 
        connotation, it forms a vital branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, 
        learning, and adaptation in machines. AI systems are now in routine use in economics, 
        medicine, engineering and the military as well as being built into many common home 
        computer software applications, and traditional strategy games like computer chess and 
        other video games.

    <li style="margin: 10px 20px ;font-weight: bolder;">HOW DOES ARTFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORK </li>
    <p>In the field of AI, it is important to understand how it works. AI is the process of creating 
        computer programs that can solve problems. AI works by processing data and making 
        decisions based on the data. It is possible to use AI to make transactions, monitor weather 
        conditions, and tasks that could be difficult for humans to do. AI has been used for centuries 
        to make some languages, data analysis and machine learning. Several tools are used, and 
        techniques are used in machine learning, Including deep learning.
        Still in developing there are many questions that remain to be answered about how it works 
        and what implications it will have on our future.a
